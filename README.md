# RESTfully Realtime Prototype

Prototyping a RESTful API with real time background synchronization via Web Sockets.

## Prototype Overview

This prototype is designed to explore the effort it would take to add a real time background synchronization layer to an existing RESTful API. In this prototype we will be using Web Sockets, however, WebRTC could be another promising technology allowing users to keep their peers in sync without relaying messages through the server.
